Based on the official passthrough example:
    http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/example_2passthrough_8c.html

For some reason I need to tell my app where to find the lib:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

Launch the program:
    mkdir ~/tmp/mountpoint
    ./passthrough ~/tmp/mountpoint
